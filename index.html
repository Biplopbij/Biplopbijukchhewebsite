<p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:20px; color:white">Pollution affects the quality of life more than one can imagine. It works in mysterious ways, sometimes which cannot be seen by the naked eye. However, it is very much present in the environment. For instance, you might not be able to see the natural gases present in the air, but they are still there. Similarly, the pollutants which are messing up the air and increasing the levels of carbon dioxide is very dangerous for humans. Increased level of carbon dioxide will lead to global warming..</p>

<p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:20px; color:white">Further, the water is polluted in the name of industrial development, religious practices and more will cause a shortage of drinking water. Without water, human life is not possible. Moreover, the way waste is dumped on the land eventually ends up in the soil and turns toxic. If land pollution keeps on happening at this rate, we won’t have fertile soil to grow our crops on. Therefore, serious measures must be taken to reduce pollution to the core.</p>

<p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:20px; color:white"><b>Air pollution</b> is the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (such as ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane, carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution may cause diseases, allergies and even death to humans; it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Both human activity and natural processes can generate air pollution.</p>
<p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:25px; color:white"><b><i>Prevention</i></b>
    <p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:20px; color:white">i.   Rnewable fuel and clean energy production<br>
    ii. Energy conservation and efficiency

<p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:20px; color:white"><b>Water pollution (or aquatic pollution)</b> is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities, in such a manner that negatively affects its legitimate uses. Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into these water bodies. For example, releasing inadequately treated wastewater into natural waters can lead to degradation of these aquatic ecosystems. All plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted water bodies can be impacted. The effects can damage individual species and impact the natural biological communities they are part of. Water pollution can also lead to water-borne diseases for people using polluted water for drinking, bathing, washing or irrigation.</p>
<p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:25px; color:white"><b><i>Prevention</i></b>
    <p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:20px; color:white">i.   Conserve water by turning off the tap when running water is not necessary.<br>  
    ii. Don’t throw garbage into rivers, lakes or oceans.

<p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:20px; color:white"><b>Soil contamination or soil pollution</b> as part of land degradation is caused by the presence of xenobiotics (human-made) chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment. It is typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of waste. The most common chemicals involved are petroleum hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (such as naphthalene and benzo(a)pyrene), solvents, pesticides, lead, and other heavy metals. Contamination is correlated with the degree of industrialization and intensity of chemical substance. The concern over soil contamination stems primarily from health risks, from direct contact with the contaminated soil, vapour from the contaminants, or from secondary contamination of water supplies within and underlying the soil. Mapping of contaminated soil sites and the resulting cleanups are time-consuming and expensive tasks, requiring extensive amounts of geology, hydrology, chemistry, computer modeling skills, and GIS in Environmental Contamination, as well as an appreciation of the history of industrial chemistry.</p>
<p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:25px; color:white"><b><i>Prevention</i></b>
    <p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:20px; color:white">i.   Use natural alternatives to toxic substances.<br>  
    ii. Plant more trees.
