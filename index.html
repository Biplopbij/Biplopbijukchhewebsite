<p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:20px; color:white">Pollution has been a long-standing problem in our world for a few decades now. It is something that poses harm to the environment, and also to us humans as a result of that. Pollution refers to when there are contaminants that pose harm to the environment, and there are four main types of it. Air pollution refers to the harmful and toxic fumes in the air produced by vehicles, factories, smoking, etc. Water pollution refers to the contamination of water bodies by toxic substances, plastic, oil spills, etc. Soil or land pollution refers to the wastage we leave on the land, and also toxic substances that seep into the soil and ruin its fertility. Noise pollution refers to unwanted and unpleasant noises; all the types of pollution are incredibly detrimental to the planet.</p>

<p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:20px; color:white">Urbanisation refers to the concept of rural towns and villages developing into urbanised towns and cities. Urban localities are characterised by having good infrastructure and prevalence of industry, both of which are almost undoubtedly linked to each other. A lot of venture capitalists and multinational corporations select smaller, rural towns to start manufacturing businesses because the factors of production most often come cheaper there. This means that the rent is lower, labour costs less, etc. thus, it makes for a convenient place to open up good-manufacturing factories there. Urbanization has demerits more than merits.</p>

<p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:20px; color:white">When a factory opens in a rural area, it paves the way for the people living in and around the area to avail employment there. Since there will be many raw material trucks coming in and goods trucks leaving from the factory site, there is a requirement for paved roads. More and more facilities and infrastructure come up around the lands surrounding the factory, resulting in the development of the area. This process is called urbanisation, and it is important to know about so you can understand how pollution due to urbanisation takes place.</p>

<p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:20px; color:white">Where there is a factory, while a lot of infrastructure and development follows it, there is also a lot of waste produced there. Many factories may not follow the correct procedure for the disposal of waste, which can be dangerous as factory waste can sometimes be toxic. This toxic waste seeps into neighbouring soil, close-by water bodies, and poisonous fumes from the factories into the air. Aside from these forms of pollution, factories can also be noisy due to the machinery used inside. Thus it causes all four types of pollution. In this way, industries produce air, water, noise, and soil pollution due to urbanisation.</p>

<p style="Font-family:verdana; Font-size:20px; color:white">While pollution on its own is a pressing problem for our world, pollution due to urbanisation is a huge problem. Adding to that, it is becoming a bigger and bigger problem as urbanisation is taking over even the smallest areas. Yes, development is something to applaud, but not when it goes to the extent of causing harm to or destroying the environment.</p>
